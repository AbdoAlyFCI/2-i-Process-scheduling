Operating system task that represent process scheduling by use 2^i method 

this important note about this console app 
(install the latest version of .NET and C#)

if you select 0 level as input will turn automatically to 1 level
if you select 0 process will work put will give Nan Value
if you leave any area without input will give exception handling error

when to try to insert process data use this format num num example 2 3
anything else will give exception handling error :)

this real case to test the app

JOP:			1	2	 3	 4	 5
Arrival Time    0	2	 4	 6	 8
Service Time    3	6	 4	 5	 2

OutPut Format 

ProcessNum		Waiting Time	Response Time
1					1			4
5					4			6
2					9			15
3					10			14
4					9			14

the output will follow the order of finished process
